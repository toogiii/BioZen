BioZen is an aquaponics system and an audiovisual kinetic art piece. The system incorporates elements of a zen garden and aquaponics, including a fish tank and a single zen plant. A cloud at the top also changes colors as the weather changes outside, and it emulates certain weathers in real time, including rains, storms, and sun. In addition, I taught a Generative Adversarial Network to compose mood music for the art piece based on the weather outside, using information from the live NOAA API as inputs. This repository includes all the source code for the NOAA inputs and an example GAN I trained as one of the AI composers based on the weather.
